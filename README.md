# Exordium

__Render the HUD and screens at a lower framerate to speed up what's really important: world rendering.__

Renders the HUD at a lower fixed framerate (configurable in the settings), freeing up CPU and GPU time for the world rendering. There is no good reason to render the hotbar at 100+ FPS.
